			<h1>Many eyes make all bugs shallow</h1>
			<p>Game design is one of those hobbies that just needs a constant stream of objective feedback. I do my absolute best to make every game bug-free. But as you get close to any project, you need an outsider's viewpoint. 
			<p>As a professor by day, I know the value of solid feedback. My usual day usually involves some sort of peer review: writing and revising publications, peer-reviewing journal articles papers, grading student work, writing grant proposals. I know that, in any creative endeavor, you get close to it. You need objectivity. You need both big picture feedback and nit picking.</p>
			<p>So, I need your help.</p>
