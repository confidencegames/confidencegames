		<h1>Many eyes make all bugs shallow</h1>
		<p>Game design is one of those hobbies that just needs a constant stream of objective feedback. I do my absolute best to make every game as great as it can be. But as you get close to any project, you need an outsider's viewpoint. You need objectivity. You need both big picture feedback and nit picking.</p>
		<p>So I need your help.</p>

		<h1>What kind of feedback are you looking for?</h1>
		<p>Here are a couple of stock questions to get you thinking.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tell me a little about yourself. What are your favorite games? </li>
			<li>Basic information
				<ul>
					<li>How many players?</li>
					<li>How many sessions of this game have you played before?</li>
					<li>How long did you play?</li>
					<li>How did you prepare for teaching the rules? Read the sheet with everyone there, or did someone read it ahead of time?</li>
					<li>What types of players played with you? What are their favorite games?</li>
					<li>What version were you testing? What date did you play?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Did it work?
				<ul>
					<li>Was there a moment that you felt the game was "broken"? Describe what happened.</li>
					<li>How close were the scores? Did everyone feel like they had a fair chance at winning?</li>
					<li>Were there any moments that you had to go back to the rules for clarification? What resulted of that - are you still unclear, or was it just a misunderstanding?</li>
					<li>Any ideas for clearer rules?</li>
					<li>Any ideas for clearer icons, artwork, in-game helps, etc?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Was it fun?
				<ul>
					<li>Based on the description, artwork, branding, etc. was this game what you expected?</li>
					<li>Were the theme, artwork, and icons engaging?</li>
					<li>Did this game have the depth of strategy that you were expecting?</li>
					<li>What were the moments that people felt like they were having the most fun? The least fun?</li>
					<li>Assuming trivial issues are fixed, would you recommend this to someone else?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>			
		</ul>

  		<h1>Do I have to buy your games?</h1>
  		<p>Nope. You're welcome to try a free print-and-play copy available on <a href="https://github.com/confidencegames">GitHub</a>. Attached to each game are also some notes with some tips for printing the game out, using sleeves, and other considerations. </p> 
  		<p>You can also just review the rules that come with the print-and-play copies. That would also be very helpful.</p>

  		<h1>How might this benefit me?</h1>
  		<p>Sadly, I cannot pay you. I'm a hobbyist who is just trying to make great games. Realistically, even I don't get paid. Any "profits" from purchases (they are usually about $1) will just get spent on future prototypes I buy for myself. What I'm asking for here is volunteer work.</p>
  		<p>That said, I can offer you a lot of other things. If you actually play the game and write a thoughtful email to me with insightful feedback, I can add your name to the list of playtesters in the credits on all future purchases (with your permission, of course). If I have room in my budget and we have a good relationship, I'll send you updated components to beta copies you've purchased. If you are a designer too, I'll consider playtesting your games too, or review your rules. </p>

  		<h1>You're not listening to me!!</h1>
  		<p>If you've ever dealt with anything creative, you're familiar with this side of the critiquing partner relationship. As you get to know me, you'll see I'm very receptive to feedback. I know not to be defensive from feedback but to hear it an process it. I also have my own creative vision. Everyone has a slightly different idea for fixing the same issues, or what the game should ultimately be. Thus, I cannot guarantee I'll react to all of your feedback. </p>
