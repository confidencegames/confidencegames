Welcome to Confidence Games! This is the online presence of my tabletop strategy games.

Here's a little bit about me. I've been a game designer since I was a kid, but more serious about it now for about six years now. I've made a lot of games, most of which are shelved for future work. But, I've got a couple of games that I've just fallen in love with and so have many other people. I'm looking to build a community around these games so we can improve them, expand them, and ultimately disseminate them.

I'm not at all about making money. This isn't a business, it's a hobby. I've observed the board game industry enough to know that even the greatest designers make only a modest living. Any money I happen to make along the way will just go back into supporting my hobby anyway :)

Well, go ahead and poke around! And be sure to [get in touch](/playtest) and let me know what you think.

Sincerely,

  Andy Meneely
