Welcome to Confidence Games! This is the online presence of my tabletop strategy games.

Here's a little bit about me. I've been a game designer since I was a kid, but more serious about it now for about six years now. I've made a lot of games, most of which are shelved for future work. But, I've got a couple of games that I've just fallen in love with and so have many other people. I'm looking to build a community around these games so we can improve them, expand them, and ultimately disseminate them.

I'm not at all about making money. I've observed the board game industry enough to know that even the greatest designers make a modest living. This isn't a business decision, it's a hobby decision. Any money I happen to make along the way will just go back into supporting my hobby anyway :)

Well, go ahead and poke around!

Sincerely,

  Andy Meneely
