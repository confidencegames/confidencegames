      <p class="lead">The year is 1919, America's golden age of grift. Clever thievery has moved from shell games and three-card monte to a more mature art form: the heist.</p>
      <p class="">In this head-to-head match, you must compete to hire a team of professional criminals, plan heists on unsuspecting marks, and muscle out your opponent to earn money. It's all about return on investment and knowing your opponent.</p>
      <p class="">The game plays in a series of 5-7 rounds, each round with three phases: The Purchase, The Plan, and The Heist. The player with the most money at the end wins.</p>

      <p class="lead">Every heist needs just the right Crew. You'll need to assemble that team.</p>
      <p>We've got 22 unique Crew cards, each with different bonuses and abilities. Grifters are highly skilled and get you to those tougher marks. Partners are better at collaborating. Thieves get you fast cash. Muscle is great for getting the Mark you want. Insiders will specialize for Marks in various neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>As the game progresses, you are able to buy more expensive, yet powerful cards.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Plan. <span class="text-muted">Choose Carefully.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Plan your heists by secretly sorting your cards in your hand. Prioritize your choices of Mark, too. </p>
      <p>For example, maybe you want your Pickpocket to go after the Sketchy Bar and you want your Fall Guy to hit the Honest Bank. To be successful, you'll need to optimize your Crew bonuses and collect Marks from the same neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Place your crew face-down when ready.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Heist. <span class="text-muted">Plans unfold.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead"> Plans are put in motion that cannot be changed! </p>
      <p>You attempt your planned heists, chaining together crew members to get the right combination of Skill and Bonus. If you run into your opponent you must rely on your best Muscle to save you.</p>
      <p>The Heist phase is entirely mechanical, and quite exciting. Once you get paid, you collect your take and head back to The Purchase phase. New, tougher Marks become available, too.</p>
      <p><small>In the example to the left, we've got a Crew with a total <abbr title="Fist icon in the upper-left">Skill</abbr> of 4 against the Gallery of Priceless Art with a <abbr title="Shield icon">Difficulty</abbr> of 4. We get $9k from the Mark, plus $1k from the Wheel Man and $3k from the Con Artist. That's $13k for this heist. Nice! If our opponent was also going after The Gallery of Priceless Art and had any Crew member with Muscle greater than 8, then they would get the Gallery of Priceless Art and we would have to go to our next choice.</small></p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Solo Campaign. <span class="text-muted">Big Payouts.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Push yourself to the limit in a three-game campaign.</p>
      <p>The rules include a solo variant where you play against a mechanical player. Victory occurs when you reach a given monetary limit, which increases each game. After each game, you get to keep Crew members <abbr title="Price in lower-right">valued</abbr> at what you exceeded your limit. For example, if the limit was $80k, and you ended with $89k, you get to keep a Grifter for the next game.</p>
      <p>Starting with high-powered Crew is a game-changer that lets you unlock new ways of getting massive payouts.</p>
