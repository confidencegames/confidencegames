      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Make Money. <span class="text-muted">Pull Heists.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">In this head-to-head match, you must compete to hire a team of professional criminals, plan heists on unsuspecting marks, and muscle out your opponent to earn money. It's all about return on investment and knowing your opponent.</p>
      <p class="lead">The game plays in a series of 5-7 rounds, each round with three phases: The Purchase, The Plan, and The Heist. The player with the most money at the end wins.</p>

      <p class="lead">Hire your Crew to pull your heists. We've got 22 Crew cards, each with unique bonuses and abilities. </p>
      <p class="lead">Your team's possibilities are endless. Grifters are highly skilled and get you to those tougher marks. Partners are better at collaborating. Thieves get you fast cash. Muscle is great for getting the Mark you want. Insiders will specialize for Marks in various neighborhoods.</p>
