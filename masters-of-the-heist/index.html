      <p class="lead">The year is 1919. America is in its golden age of grift. Clever thievery has moved from shell games and three-card monte to a more mature art form: the heist.</p>
      <p class="">In this head-to-head match, you must compete to hire a team of professional criminals, plan heists on unsuspecting marks, and muscle out your opponent to earn money. It's all about return on investment and knowing your opponent. The player with the most money at the end wins.</p>
      <p class="">The game plays in a series of 5-7 rounds, each round with three phases: The Purchase, The Plan, and The Heist. </p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Purchase. <span class="text-muted">Spend Wisely.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Every heist needs just the right Crew. You'll need to assemble that team.</p>
      <p>We've got 22 unique Crew cards, each with different bonuses and abilities. Grifters are highly skilled and get you to those tougher marks. Partners are better at collaborating. Thieves get you fast cash. Muscle is great for getting the Mark you want. Insiders are useful specalists.</p>
      <p>As the game progresses, new Crew members become more powerful, yet increasingly expensive.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Plan. <span class="text-muted">Choose Carefully.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Plan your heists by secretly sorting your cards in your hand. Prioritize your choices of Mark, too. </p>
      <p>For example, maybe you want your Pickpocket to go after the Sketchy Bar and you want your Fall Guy to hit the Honest Bank. To be successful, you'll need to optimize your Crew bonuses and collect Marks from the same neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Place your crew face-down when ready.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Heist. <span class="text-muted">Plans unfold.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead"> Plans are put in motion that cannot be changed! </p>
      <p>You attempt your planned heists, chaining together crew members to get the right combination of Skill and Bonus. If you run into your opponent you must rely on your best Muscle to save you.</p>
      <p>The Heist phase is entirely mechanical, and quite exciting. Once you get paid, you collect your take and head back to The Purchase phase. Tougher yet more lucrative Marks are revealed.</p>
      <p><small>In the example to the left, we've got a Crew with a total <abbr title="Fist icon in the upper-left">Skill</abbr> of 4 against the Gallery of Priceless Art with a <abbr title="Shield icon">Difficulty</abbr> of 4. We get $9k from the Mark, plus $1k from the Wheel Man and $3k from the Con Artist. That's $13k for this heist. Nice! If our opponent was also going after The Gallery of Priceless Art and had any Crew member with Muscle greater than 8, then they would get the Gallery of Priceless Art and we would have to go to our next choice.</small></p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Solo Campaign. <span class="text-muted">Big Payouts.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Push yourself to the limit in a three-game campaign.</p>
      <p>The rules include a solo variant where you play against a mechanical player. You are victorious if you end with a set goal, which increases each game. After each game, you get to keep Crew members <abbr title="Price in lower-right of Crew cards">valued</abbr> at what you exceeded your limit. For example, if the limit was $80k, and you ended with $89k, you get to keep a Con Arist for the next game.</p>
      <p>Starting with high-powered Crew is a game-changer that lets you unlock new ways of getting massive payouts.</p>
      <p>The solo campaign is also a great way to play the game cooperatively, or learn the deck on your own.</p>

      <p>Currently, I consider this game in Beta stage. The artwork is pretty much set and the gameplay fundamentals are solidified. There's still some  playtesting and tweaking to be made on the rules, the solo campaign, and some attributes here and there. I need to broaden beta tester base.</p>
      <p>If you would like to be a playtester, please check out the <a href="/playtest">playtest page</a> for more info on what kind of feedback I'm looking for and what's in it for you (spoiler alert: I can't pay you, but there are tangible benefits).</p>
      <p>Or... just purchase and enjoy the game as it is right now! I hope you like it.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Free print-and-play <span class="text-muted">prototype.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Want to try it out yourself? It's <abbr title="...as in beer!">free!</abbr> <a href="https://github.com/confidencegames/masters-of-the-heist-pnp">On Github</a></p>
      <p>Not quite ready to buy? That's fine, you can play the game for free. You just need to be willing to print out the PDFs, and cut the cards yourself. It usually takes me about 20 minutes to cut them and put them into sleeves. The game is kept precisely equivalent to the beta copy.</p>
      <p>Be sure to check out the attached PnP notes on the download for tips.</p>
      <p>The rules are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/confidencegames/masters-of-the-heist-pnp">GitHub</a>.</p>
