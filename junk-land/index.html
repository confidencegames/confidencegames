      <p class="lead">It's been nearly half a century since the Garbage Wars. Junk Land is the only home you know, and collecting scrap is the only way you know how to live.</p>
      <p class="lead">...actually, it's a great way to live! Let's get to work. Where's my duct tape? </p>
      <p class="">In this resource-driven card game for 1-4 players, you're an optimistic, scrappy adventurer set in a paradoxically lush wasteland of junk. You need to be the first to build one of the many super cool things you can make with the scrap you collect.</p>
      <p>But you can only carry so much at a time.</p>
      <p class="">This card game plays in a series of about 7-10 turns for each player, resulting in quick 20-30 minute games. I consider Junk Land to currently be in the Alpha stage, as the artwork has a long way to go. The game, however, is quite well-tested and mature. I am attempting some artwork myself, but I could use any <a href="/playtest">volunteers</a> who are good with silly illustrations.</p>

      <p class="lead">I have room for this, right?</p>
      <p>Items are cards that let you collect resources and get interesting bonuses. Items can be stacked into piles, but only the top card on the pile provides a bonus. Increase your Capacity to get more piles.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Scrap Stuff.<span class="text-muted"> Yay more stuff!</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Down to the essentials: string, wood, metal, and glass.</p>
      <p>Simplify your inventory by scrapping Items at any time down to their essential components. The tough part is knowing when to keep that neat item for its bonus, or to scrap it for something better. Scrapping means you get to make more stuff, but is also harder to carry because each element type counts as a pile!</p>
      <p>Duct Tape is scarce and critical resource. It's lost when scrapping, so it cannot be found in items. You must use other, more clever means of acquiring duct tape.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Build Blueprints. <span class="text-muted">Yay cool stuff!</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">I need that!</p>
      <p>Blueprints are an ever-changing array of choices for you to build with your stuff. Bonuses include things like Initiative (starting player), Capacity (the ability to carry more stuff), Conversion (convert some stuff to other stuff!), and Collection (get more stuff each turn!). Blueprints are powerful, but they leave the rotation every few turns so you'd better make your move. Most blueprints require Duct Tape.</p>
      <p>The first person to build an Awesome Blueprint wins the game immediately. Awesome Blueprints are always available, but tough to build. They all require six duct tape, for example. </p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Make Friends.<span class="text-muted"> Friends with stuff!</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Friends are useful, permanent bonuses that you can collect throughout the game. </p>
      <p>Friends can do things like convert resources, give permanent initiative boosts, increase your capacity, or just give you more stuff each turn. They don't require capacity to carry, so you can collect as many as you like. They come and go very quickly, however, so grab them when you can. </p>

      <p class="lead">Maximize your bonuses. Keep a Friend.</p>
      <p>The rules include a three-game solo campaign where you have a limited time to build an Awesome Blueprint. The gameplay becomes more about maximizing the bonuses than thwarting your opponent. Friends get to be kept from one game to the next</p>
      <p>The bonuses are also part of a rich iconographic language that are easy to track and straightforward to interpret.</p>

      <p class="lead">Want to try it out yourself? It's <abbr title="...as in beer!">free!</abbr> <a href="https://github.com/confidencegames/junk-land-pnp">On Github</a></p>
      <p>Not quite ready to buy? That's fine, you can play the game for free. You just need to be willing to print out the PDFs, and cut the cards yourself. It usually takes me about 20 minutes to cut them and put them into sleeves.</p>
      <p>Be sure to check out the attached PnP notes on the download for tips.</p>
      <p>The rules are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/confidencegames/junk-land-pnp">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p class="lead">Unfortunately, I'm not an illustrator.</p>
      <p>Many people have expressed interest in this game. I'm just a hobbyist, but I'm hoping for someone out there who would also like to draw over fifty junk-filled illustrations for just the love of the game and the hobby. I know it's a lot and I am not holding my breath. Until then, the game will be just words, icons, a blank spot in the middle, with the occasional doodle.</p>
