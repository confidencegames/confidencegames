      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Grab It. <span class="text-muted">Scrap it.</span> Store it. <span class="text-muted">Build it.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">It's been nearly half a century since the Garbage Wars. Junk Land is the only home you know, and collecting scrap is the only way you know how to live.</p>
      <p class="lead">...actually, it's a great way to live! Let's get to work. Where's my duct tape? </p>
      <p class="">In this resource-driven card game, you're an optimistic, scrappy adventurer set in a wildly fantastical wasteland. You need to be the first to build one of the many super cool things you can make with scrap. But you can only carry so much at a time. Maybe you want to scrap your Lumber Mill to build a Pollution-Powered Submarine. Or maybe just befriend the Duck Major to get more duct tape. Just beat your opponent to building a Victory Blueprint and you win!</p>
      <p class="">This card game plays in a series of about 7-10 turns for each player, resulting in quick 20-30 minute games. </p>
      <p>I consider Junk Land to currently be in the Alpha stage, as the artwork has a long way to go. Any <a href="/playtest">volunteers</a> who are good with silly illustrations?</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Build Blueprints. <span class="text-muted">Yay cool stuff!</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Blueprints are an ever-changing array of choices for you to build with your stuff. Bonuses include things like Initiative (starting player), Capacity (the ability to carry more stuff), Conversion (convert some stuff to other stuff!), and Collection (get more stuff each turn!). Blueprints are powerful, but they go away quickly so you'd better make your move. Most Blueprints require Duct Tape, which is a precious commodity in Junk Land.</p>
      <p class="lead">Awesome Blueprints are always available, but tough to build. The first person to build an Awesome Blueprint wins the game immediately.</p>

      <p class="lead">Want to try it out yourself? It's <abbr title="...as in beer!">free!</abbr> <a href="https://github.com/confidencegames/junk-land-pnp">On Github</a></p>
      <p>Not quite ready to buy? That's fine, you can play the game for free. You just need to be willing to print out the PDFs, and cut the cards yourself. It usually takes me about 20 minutes to cut them and put them into sleeves. The game is kept precisely equivalent to the beta copy.</p>
      <p>Be sure to check out the attached PnP notes on the download for tips.</p>
      <p>The rules are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/confidencegames/junk-land-pnp">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p class="lead">Many people have expressed interest in this game. Unfortunately, I'm not an illustrator. I'm just a hobbyist, but I'm hoping for someone out there who would also like to draw over fifty junk-filled illustrations for just the love of the game and the hobby. I know it's a lot and I am not holding my breath. Until then, the game will be just words, icons, and a blank spot in the middle.</p>
