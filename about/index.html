			<h1>What is Confidence Games?</h1>
			<p>It's a brand. I'm just a hobbyist who likes to make tabletop strategy games in his spare time. I needed a place for my games to live, so here we are.</p>
			<p>If you're more interested about me professionally, my name is <a href="http://www.se.rit.edu/~andy">Andy Meneely</a>. By day, I'm an assistant professor of Software Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I hold a PhD in Computer Science and I also majored in Mathematics in college. My research focuses on using analytics and empirical methods to improve the way software engineers write code. </p>
			<p>So there is no getting around it. I am a bonafide nerd.</p>

			<h1>What's with the name?</h1>
			<p>I love a great con. The world of scheming and scamming has become folklore, an entire genre of storytelling, and classic Americana. There's an old prohibition-era saying that goes something like this: </p>
			<blockquote>"A good thief will take whatever you have on you. But a grifter will have you going back home for more." </blockquote>

			<p>To me, a good confidence game is a lot like a good board game. The crazy plot twists. The come-from-behind victories. You have to rely on your wits to react to all circumstances. The inherent game theory mentality of "I'll do this then he'll do that". The strategies that emerge from years of mastering tactics. Even that dry, witty humor of a good heist movie reminds me of the tabletop gaming culture. </p>
			<p>As you see from games like Masters of the Heist, I love the idea of prohibition-era grifters as a theme, too. I love that gritty look and feel of organized crime juxtaposed with wealth and opulence. It's a revered and beloved time in American history. Not all of my game themes are in that universe, of course, but I do love it.</p>
